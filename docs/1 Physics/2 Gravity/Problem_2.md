# Problem 2

# **Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities**  


## **Motivation**  


The concept of **escape velocity** is fundamental in astrophysics and space exploration. 
It determines the minimum speed required for an object to break free from a celestial body's gravitational pull. 

Expanding on this, the **first, second, and third cosmic velocities** define the speed thresholds needed for stable orbit, escape from a planet, and even escape from an entire star system. 
These principles are essential for launching satellites, interplanetary missions, and potential future interstellar travel.  

## **Definitions of Cosmic Velocities**  


1. **First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity, $v_1$)**  


   - The minimum speed needed for an object to stay in a **stable circular orbit** around a celestial body without propulsion.  


   - Derived from balancing **gravitational force** and **centripetal force**:  


     $$
     v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}
     $$


   - Example: A satellite in **low Earth orbit** (LEO) must travel at **~7.91 km/s**.  



2. **Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity, $v_2$)**  


   - The speed required to **escape completely** from a planetâ€™s gravitational influence.  


   - Derived from **energy conservation** (gravitational potential energy vs. kinetic energy):  



     $$
     v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
     $$



   - It is **$\sqrt{2}$ times** the first cosmic velocity. 


   - Example:
   
    On Earth, $v_2 \approx 11.2$ km/s, meaning a rocket must reach this speed to leave Earth without further propulsion.  




3. **Third Cosmic Velocity (Stellar Escape Velocity, $v_3$)**  


   - The speed needed to escape **the gravitational pull of the entire solar system** (or another star system).  


   - Depends on **both the Sunâ€™s gravity** and the **planetâ€™s position** in its orbit:  


     $$
     v_3 = \sqrt{v_2^2 + v_s^2}
     $$


     where $v_s$ is the planetâ€™s orbital velocity around the Sun.  


   - Example:
   
    To **leave the Solar System from Earthâ€™s orbit**, $v_3 \approx 42.1$ km/s.  


## **Mathematical Analysis & Visualization**  


Below is a Python script to calculate and plot the **first, second, and third cosmic velocities** for different celestial bodies (**Earth, Mars, and Jupiter**).

## **Space Exploration Applications**  


- **Launching satellites**: The **first cosmic velocity** determines the speed needed for stable orbits (e.g., ISS at ~7.66 km/s).  


- **Interplanetary missions**: The **second cosmic velocity** is crucial for rockets escaping planetary gravity (e.g., Apollo missions).  


- **Leaving the Solar System**: Probes like **Voyager 1 & 2** reached the **third cosmic velocity** to exit the Solar System.  



## **Conclusion**  


The concept of **cosmic velocities** is fundamental for space travel. Understanding these speed thresholds allows engineers to design missions that **place satellites in orbit, send spacecraft to Mars, and even explore beyond the Solar System**. ðŸš€
