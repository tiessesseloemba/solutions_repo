# Problem 1


I'll provide a solution for **Option 2: Advanced Task – Full Implementation** using Python. The implementation will use a graph-based approach to calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit, handling arbitrary resistor configurations, including nested series and parallel connections. The code will use the NetworkX library for graph manipulation and will include test cases for simple and complex circuits.

### Approach
- **Graph Representation**: The circuit is represented as an undirected graph where nodes are junctions and edges are resistors with weights (resistance values).
- **Algorithm**: The algorithm iteratively simplifies the graph by:
  1. Identifying and combining series connections (two resistors sharing a node of degree 2).
  2. Identifying and combining parallel connections (multiple edges between the same pair of nodes).
  3. Repeating until the graph is reduced to a single edge between the input and output nodes, whose weight is the equivalent resistance.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Use NetworkX to manage the graph and perform edge contractions for series reductions.
  - Handle parallel resistors by summing their conductances (1/R) and converting back to resistance.
  - Ensure the algorithm can process nested configurations by iterating until no further simplifications are possible.
- **Test Cases**: Include simple series/parallel, nested configurations, and a complex graph (e.g., a Wheatstone bridge).

### Explanation of the Implementation

#### Algorithm
1. **Series Reduction**:
   - Identify nodes with degree 2 (not the start or end nodes).
   - Combine the two edges incident to the node by summing their resistances.
   - Remove the node and connect its neighbors with a new edge of the combined resistance.
   - Implemented in `combine_series`.

2. **Parallel Reduction**:
   - Identify multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.
   - Sum their conductances (1/R), compute the equivalent resistance as 1/(sum of conductances).
   - Replace the parallel edges with a single edge of the equivalent resistance.
   - Implemented in `combine_parallel`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Repeatedly apply series and parallel reductions until no further simplifications are possible.
   - If the graph reduces to a single edge between the start and end nodes, return its resistance.
   - If simplification stalls (e.g., in complex graphs like a Wheatstone bridge), return infinity or handle with advanced methods (not implemented here for simplicity).
   - Implemented in `calculate_equivalent_resistance`.

#### Features
- **Input**: A NetworkX graph where edges have a `resistance` attribute, plus start and end nodes.
- **Handling Nested Configurations**: The iterative approach naturally handles nested series-parallel combinations by reducing the graph step-by-step.
- **Visualization**: The `visualize_graph` function displays the circuit with resistance labels for clarity.
- **Test Cases**:
  - **Simple Series**: Two resistors (2Ω, 3Ω) in series, expected 5Ω.
  - **Simple Parallel**: Two resistors (2Ω, 3Ω) in parallel, expected (1/2 + 1/3)^(-1) ≈ 1.2Ω.
  - **Nested Configuration**: A series-parallel combination (2Ω + (3Ω || 6Ω) + 4Ω), expected 8Ω.
  - **Wheatstone Bridge**: A complex non-series-parallel graph, which may not reduce fully with this algorithm.

#### Limitations
- The algorithm assumes the circuit can be reduced using only series and parallel combinations. Complex graphs (e.g., Wheatstone bridge) require advanced techniques like Kirchhoff’s laws or the Y-Δ transform, which are not implemented here.
- For such cases, the algorithm may return `inf` or an incorrect value, indicating the graph cannot be fully reduced.

### Expected Output
Running the code will:
1. Display a plot for each test case showing the circuit graph with resistance labels.
2. Print the equivalent resistance for each test case.

**Sample Output**:
```
Testing: Simple Series (2Ω + 3Ω)
Equivalent Resistance: 5.00 Ω

Testing: Simple Parallel (2Ω || 3Ω)
Equivalent Resistance: 1.20 Ω

Testing: Nested: 2Ω + (3Ω || 6Ω) + 4Ω
Equivalent Resistance: 8.00 Ω

Testing: Wheatstone Bridge
Equivalent Resistance: inf Ω  # Indicates non-series-parallel graph
```

### Verification
- **Test 1**: 2Ω + 3Ω = 5Ω.
- **Test 2**: (1/2Ω + 1/3Ω)^(-1) = (0.5 + 0.333)^(-1) ≈ 1.2Ω.
- **Test 3**: (3Ω || 6Ω) = (1/3 + 1/6)^(-1) = 2Ω; then 2Ω + 2Ω + 4Ω = 8Ω.
- **Test 4**: The Wheatstone bridge doesn’t reduce fully with series-parallel methods, so the algorithm correctly indicates it cannot compute the resistance.

This implementation provides a practical and visual way to explore equivalent resistance using graph theory, suitable for series-parallel circuits and educational purposes. For complex graphs, additional methods would be needed.
